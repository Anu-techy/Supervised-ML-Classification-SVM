# Supervised-ML-Classification-Support Vector Machine

SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used primarily for classification tasks (but also for regression). 

The main idea behind SVM is to find the best decision boundary (or hyperplane) that separates classes of data.

🏞️ Imagine This...

Say you have two types of data points: red dots and blue triangles.

You want to draw a line (in 2D) or a plane (in 3D), or more generally a hyperplane, that separates the two groups as well as possible.

But SVM doesn’t just draw any line — it draws the one that maximizes the margin between the two groups.

📏 Margin?

The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest points from each class (called support vectors).

SVM finds the line that gives you the widest possible margin. This helps improve the model’s ability to generalize well on unseen data.
